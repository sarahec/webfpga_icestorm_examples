WebFPGA - FPGA IceStorm Examples
================================

This repository contains a couple of Verilog examples. (In fact, these
examples are stripped verbatim from our website.) We have added
a Makefile that shows a functional build and flash process using IceStorm
with our board.

## Examples
* blinky.v: blinks the LED once a second using the internal oscillator
* top.v: fades the on-board RGB Neopixel
